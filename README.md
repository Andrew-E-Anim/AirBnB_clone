# Airbnb Clone Project.

#### This is a project where we aim to clone the functionality of the popular online booking website, AirBnB. The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help us to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

#### What’s a command interpreter?
We will create a simple consolewhere we will be able to manage our projects.

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
